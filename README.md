## Project Description

CardinalSite is a web application developed using the Django framework to provide a comprehensive solution for managing clients, employees, and weekly data in a company. The application aims to streamline the management of client information, employee records, and weekly reports, enabling efficient tracking, analysis, and reporting of key data. CardinalSite offers an intuitive user interface and essential features to enhance productivity and decision-making within the organization.

## Features

- **Client Management**: Easily add, update, and delete client information, including name, contact details, and address. Keep track of client interactions, communication history, and manage client relationships effectively. View client details and associated weekly data for comprehensive insights.

- **Employee Management**: Manage employee records, including their names, roles, contact information, and assignment to specific projects or tasks. Keep employee data organized and easily accessible. Monitor employee work hours, tasks, and performance. Generate reports to evaluate employee productivity and allocate resources efficiently.

- **Week Management**: Keep track of weekly data, such as start and end dates, hours worked, tasks completed, and project progress. Create new weeks, assign employees to specific weeks, and record daily work hours. View weekly summaries and generate reports to analyze productivity, identify trends, and monitor project progress.

- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication system to protect sensitive data and ensure authorized access. Different user roles can be assigned, such as admin, manager, or employee, with varying levels of access and permissions. Safeguard your data and maintain control over user activities.

- **Data Visualization**: Visualize data using charts and graphs for better insights into the company's performance. Analyze key metrics, such as revenue, project progress, and employee productivity, through visual representations. Make data-driven decisions and identify areas for improvement.
